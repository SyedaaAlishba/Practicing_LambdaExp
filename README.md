# Lambda Expressions in Java 🚀

## 📌 What is a Lambda Expression?
A **lambda expression** in Java is a **short way of writing methods** (functions) without naming them.  
It is mainly used to implement **functional interfaces** (interfaces with exactly one abstract method).

👉 General Syntax:
```java
(parameters) -> { body }

````

## ✅ Why Use Lambdas?

* Makes code **shorter and cleaner**
* Avoids writing **extra classes** just to implement one method
* Used heavily with **Java Streams, Collections, and functional programming**
